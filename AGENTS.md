# OpenCircle — agent guide

OpenCircle brings Android's "Circle to Search" to the desktop (Windows and
Linux). Press a shortcut, the screen freezes, circle or drag over anything,
and search it (Google Lens), read it (OCR), translate it, or ask an AI about
it. A second mode snips and annotates screenshots (region, window, full,
scrolling; arrows, text, blur, steps; copy, save, pin). Stack: **pure Rust,
one binary, UI in `iced`** (no web view — lightweight is a hard
requirement). Spikes live in `spikes/` (throwaway). The plan lives
in `docs/internal/PLAN.md`, the UI/UX spec in `docs/internal/DESIGN.md`
(both local only). Status: **planning — no code until the owner approves the
plan.**

**Start of every session: read `AGENTS.local.md`** (gitignored, beside this
file): logins and machine-specific notes. Then `docs/internal/NEXT_SESSION.md`,
then this project's items on the Projects HQ board.

## General rules

The owner's general working rules are private. `AGENTS.local.md` says where
they are; read them at the start of every session. Project rules below win
where they differ.

## Never

- Never log, report, export or commit a secret (AI API keys live only in the
  OS keyring, never in the config file, logs or crash reports).
- Never send a capture anywhere the user didn't choose. Every network action
  (Lens, AI, translate) is an explicit user action or an explicit opt-in
  setting. No telemetry. No third-party image hosts (imgur, uguu, …).
- Never ship a capture to disk except where the user saves it; temp files are
  deleted when the overlay closes.
- Never copy Google's code, logos, icons or copy. Clean-room: we rebuild the
  behaviour, not the assets. Name, icon and visuals are our own.
- Never publish a GitHub release without the owner's OK for that release
  (the release workflow creates **drafts**).
- Frozen contracts: none yet. Once released, the CLI (`opencircle capture …`)
  and the config file format become frozen (migrate, never break).

## Architecture

Planned layout (details and change recipes: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, written with
the first code):

| Part | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/capture/` | Screen capture per platform (xcap / windows-capture / portal) |
| `src/hotkey/` | Global shortcuts (`global-hotkey`; Wayland GlobalShortcuts portal; CLI fallback) |
| `src/actions/` | One file per action: lens, ocr, translate, ai, copy, save. Registry = one list (action bar and quick actions share it) |
| `src/translate/` | OCR → erase → translate → redraw pipeline; live layer |
| `src/ai/` | Two clients only: Anthropic Messages, OpenAI-compatible (covers OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio, OpenRouter) |
| `src/ui/` | iced windows: overlay, action bar, panels, snip editor (one file per annotation tool), settings, onboarding; `theme.rs` = the only colour tokens |
| `src/config.rs` | The one config reader/validator (TOML) |

## Commands

    cargo fmt --check
    cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
    cargo test
    cargo packager --release

(Exact scripts are created with the scaffold; update this block then.)

## Environments

Local dev only: WSL2 (this machine) for Linux builds, a Windows host for
Windows runs. CI runners: `ubuntu-22.04`, `windows-latest`. No servers, no
production systems.

## Owner decisions

- Repository (owner, 2026-10-23): public GitHub repo, created by the owner.
  Internal docs stay in gitignored docs/internal/.
- License (owner, 2026-10-23): MIT.
- Private rules (owner, 2026-10-23): the owner's engineering prompts are
  secret — never copy, quote or name them in tracked files.
- Stack (owner, 2026-10-23): pure Rust, UI in iced, no web view — the app
  must be super lightweight (target < 40 MB RAM idle). egui and Slint were
  considered: egui lacks bidi for mixed Arabic/English lines, Slint's RTL is
  unconfirmed.
- Platforms (owner, 2026-10-23): Windows and Linux first. macOS later, maybe.
- Full-screen translate (owner, 2026-10-23): top-priority feature, copy of
  Circle to Search's translate, built for games (in-place, live mode, tap to
  explain in context). Must feel excellent, not "good enough". The original
  text is erased (inpainted) and the translation drawn in its place with
  matched colour/size/alignment — never a box laid over it.
- Quick actions (owner, 2026-10-23): every action also gets a direct global
  shortcut that runs it without the floating action bar.
- Snip mode (owner, 2026-10-23): include a screenshot + annotate tool modelled
  on IObit's iTop Screenshot 1.2.3 (region/window/full/scrolling, annotate,
  copy/save), rebuilt clean-room from its behaviour, never from its binary.
  Scrolling capture is in v0.1; annotation must be more modern than iTop
  (smart shapes, curved arrows, callouts, spotlight — see DESIGN.md).
- Edit in place (owner, 2026-10-23): the action bar's Edit (`E`) turns the
  same floating bar into the editing toolbar (shapes, arrows, blur, text,
  steps, …) with a back arrow to the actions; works on any capture. One
  editor shared with Snip mode.
- Visual consistency (owner, 2026-10-23): controls of the same kind look
  identical — same width, height, radius, spacing and alignment (e.g. every
  shortcut field is the same width with one keycap per key). No crowded
  rows of options: group them behind one control (e.g. one colour button
  opening a picker instead of a row of swatches).
- Themes (owner, 2026-10-23): Light, Dark and System, from one token set.
- Workflow (owner, 2026-10-23): planning first; execution starts only after
  the owner reviews the plan and adds rules.
- Releases (owner rules): unsigned binaries, GitHub Releases via Actions,
  owner approves each publish.

## Domain quirks

- Wayland forbids global key grabs and silent screenshots: use the
  xdg-desktop-portal (Screenshot, GlobalShortcuts). The GlobalShortcuts portal
  is missing on some desktops → fallback: user binds `opencircle capture` in
  their desktop's shortcut settings.
- `Windows.Media.Ocr` officially needs package identity (MSIX) → we use the
  cross-platform PaddleOCR (ONNX Runtime) engine instead.
- Google Lens has no public upload API. Existing clones upload to imgur/uguu
  (privacy leak). Our approach: the browser itself posts the image to Lens
  through a local auto-submitting form (spike S1 in the plan proves it).
